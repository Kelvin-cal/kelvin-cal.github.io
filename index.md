        <h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>
        <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p> Hello, I am making this website for my school computer class presentation<br>
        <h2>How I Made This</h2>
        <h3>Khan Academmy</h3>
            <p>When I started thinking about making this website I immeaditally thought of<br>
             Khan Academy because they have a great HTML and CSS course to get me started<br> 
            learning the skills I need to make this website possible.</p>
        <h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>
            <p>I used Visual Studio Code as my source code editor becuase it has tons of<br>
             customisation, features, and plugins.</p>
        <h3>HTML & CSS </h3>
            <p>The main body of thisi website is comprised of HTML and CSS. I used HTML for the<br>
            words and CSS to makeit all look cool.</p>
        <h3>Github</h3>
            <p>In order to be able to see my website on the internet I need to host it on a<br>
            server and I chose to host my website on github, a code repository, that also has <br>
             a website hosting service</p>
        <h2>What I learned</h2>
            <p>In doing this progect I have learned about the basics of HTML, CSS, and the<br>
             basic knowlige of how to program. and I think that these skills would help<br>
             me very much in my carear even if I am not a website designer.</p>
